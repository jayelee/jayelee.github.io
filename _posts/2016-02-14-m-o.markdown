5am every morning like clockwork. Lemon water. Finish off 10km over 30 minutes. It's easy as long as I put my mind on it. NO distractions. Just pure grit. Cool down and wash off. Meditate.

Code. Pure bliss. Time freezes. Bask.

7am. Eat, prepare for the grind. 

Focus. Squeeze time for the dream. One day I will get off the grind. Faith.

Enjoy the journey. Sleep only when I'm done.

Stay obsessed. Everything else pales.
