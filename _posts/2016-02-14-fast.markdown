Thought at the speed of light. You are only as fast as you set out to be. Trash the conventional wisdom that slow and steady wins the race. Go fast, stumble and get up again. Feel the thrill.

This is the era of rapid application. Rip through theories, they ain't that hard. Get bored fast, and move quickly. Ain't much time to lose.

Rev up my internal tempo. It's not time to retire yet. The dreams are still out there. The lump in my throat will not go away by ignoring it. Swallow it. Face the unknowns and plunge into the shark tank.

Go fast or go home. No more round numbers. It starts now.
