Writing is a chore.

Words used to flow through my veins onto my fingertips like magic. It was as if the keyboard was an extension of my anatomy. I used to write and write summoning words like a skilled conductor in the orchestra of thoughts.

I have not written for 7 years, except for instructional emails and short texts. To put my thoughts in words becomes unnatural. 

My profession requires me to be concise, quantitative and directive. Being in a leadership role makes me think critically and use words with care. I became stingy with words because I truly understand how long verbose emails diminishes its impact. I now write for impact, instead for expression.

I need to get back to be able to express myself freely again. To be able to pick my thoughts apart and be comfortable with having writing that yields no outcome. I need to write for myself.

After all, what is there to be afraid about? I am under a pseudonym in this era of information overload. With the avalanche of articles from bloggers, social media influencers, thought leaders, this space of mine will maintain undiscovered only for the few who stumble upon it.

If you stumble upon this, I hope you start writing too.
